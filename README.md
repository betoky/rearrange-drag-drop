# Drag and Drop

A simple drag-and-drop sorting project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Drag elements to reorder them within the container.
- Smooth interaction using the drag-and-drop API.
- Simple and lightweight with no dependencies.

## How It Works
1. Each box inside the container is draggable.
2. When you start dragging, the element is marked as `dragging`.
3. While dragging over another element, the positions swap based on the document order.
4. The item is placed in its new position when dragging ends.
